# INTRODUCTION

>  ## 1.1 Overview <br>
> 
>  The "AUST BUDDY" project is a university assistant application for different students. This mobile application is built in Android Studio and is developed in kotlin and the database is managed by Firebase.  

>  ## 1.2 Purpose<br>
> 
> This software primarily focuses on maintaining, viewing, saving, and storing the different things of a student to make life easier. As well as some unique features there are also basic features such as user login. After completing a signup form new users can sign in easily. One will be able to register using the university email only and password. It has a facility where a student will be getting different announcements like blood donation requests etc. 
They can also find materials links, Aust website’s, teacher’s info, create groups, post quiz schedules in a group, get bus timings, calculate GPA, bookmark websites, post requests to admin for materials and teachers, create a favorite teacher list, and contact the teachers easily.
Overall, the primary goal of this project is to provide a hassle-free semester for users as well as to save time looking for notes and questions here and there. It will be a valuable asset while taking preparation for the final.


> > ## 1.2.1 Background Study<br>
